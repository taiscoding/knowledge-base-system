## Test Status

All 89 tests are now passing with the following coverage:

| Component | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| knowledge_base/__init__.py | 100% |
| knowledge_base/cli.py | 89% |
| knowledge_base/content_types.py | 97% |
| knowledge_base/manager.py | 75% |
| knowledge_base/privacy.py | 0% (Legacy) |
| knowledge_base/privacy/__init__.py | 100% |
| knowledge_base/privacy/session_manager.py | 100% |
| knowledge_base/privacy/smart_anonymization.py | 89% |
| knowledge_base/privacy/token_intelligence_bridge.py | 90% |
| knowledge_base/utils/__init__.py | 100% |
| knowledge_base/utils/config.py | 71% |
| knowledge_base/utils/helpers.py | 28% |
| **TOTAL** | **72%** |

## Next Steps

Based on our documentation updates and test improvements, the following next steps are recommended:

1. **Improve Coverage in Utility Modules**
   - Add more tests for utils/helpers.py (28% coverage)
   - Improve test coverage for utils/config.py (71% coverage)

2. **Enhance Manager Testing**
   - Add more tests for complex content processing in manager.py
   - Add tests for edge cases in extraction logic
   - Improve test fixtures for manager tests

3. **Address Legacy Code**
   - Remove or refactor the legacy privacy.py file (0% coverage)

4. **Expand Integration Testing**
   - Add more integration tests for complex workflows
   - Create end-to-end tests that exercise the entire system

These updates complete the documentation reorganization portion of the system improvements. The knowledge base system now has clean, comprehensive, and consistent documentation covering its features, architecture, testing approach, and performance characteristics.
