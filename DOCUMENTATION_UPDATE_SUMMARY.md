## Test Status

All 36 privacy component tests are now passing with the following coverage:

| Component | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| knowledge_base/privacy/__init__.py | 100% |
| knowledge_base/privacy/session_manager.py | 100% |
| knowledge_base/privacy/smart_anonymization.py | 88% |
| knowledge_base/privacy/token_intelligence_bridge.py | 96% |
| **TOTAL** | **93%** |

## Performance Benchmarks

The benchmark tests revealed the following performance metrics:

| Operation | Performance | Per-operation Time |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Deidentify (Small Text) | ~14,492 ops/sec | ~69μs |
| Deidentify (Medium Text) | ~3,469 ops/sec | ~288μs |
| Deidentify (Large Text) | ~364 ops/sec | ~2.75ms |
| Reconstruct | ~49,858 ops/sec | ~20μs |
| Token Consistency | ~30,316 ops/sec | ~33μs |
| Session Create | ~8,997 ops/sec | ~111μs |
| Session Update | ~13,444 ops/sec | ~74μs |

## Next Steps

Based on our documentation updates and test fixes, the following next steps are recommended:

1. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Implement tests for KnowledgeBaseManager
   - Add tests for CLI interface and API endpoints
   - Develop more integration tests

2. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Implement batch processing for multiple texts
   - Add client-side caching for token intelligence results
   - Pre-compile regex patterns at initialization

3. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Add examples to function docstrings
   - Create a comprehensive testing guide
   - Document error handling patterns

4. **Code Refinement**
   - Continue refactoring other components based on the patterns established
   - Enhance code organization and modularization
   - Improve error handling consistency

These updates complete the documentation portion of the privacy component improvements. The knowledge base system now has comprehensive documentation covering its privacy features, testing approach, and performance characteristics.
