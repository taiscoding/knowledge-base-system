# Frequently Asked Questions

This document answers common questions about the Knowledge Base & Token Intelligence System.

## General Questions

### What is the Knowledge Base & Token Intelligence System?

The Knowledge Base & Token Intelligence System is a privacy-first knowledge management system that combines intuitive organization with privacy-preserving intelligence. It helps you organize notes, tasks, events, and other content while generating insights without exposing your sensitive information.

### How is this different from other note-taking or knowledge management tools?

Unlike traditional knowledge management tools that process all your data directly, our system is built around privacy by design. The key differences are:

1. **Privacy-First Architecture**: Your sensitive information is tokenized before processing
2. **Token Intelligence**: The system generates insights from tokens without seeing original data
3. **Seamless Integration**: Privacy layer, knowledge base, and intelligence work together
4. **Contextual Understanding**: The system understands relationships between content without compromising privacy

### Is the system open source?

Yes, the Knowledge Base & Token Intelligence System is open source under the MIT license. You can find the code on GitHub, contribute to the project, and use it for your own purposes.

## Privacy Questions

### How does the privacy tokenization work?

The privacy tokenization process works as follows:

1. Your sensitive information (names, locations, etc.) is identified
2. Each piece of sensitive information is replaced with a token (e.g., `[PERSON_001]`)
3. Only these tokens are processed by the intelligence system
4. The mapping between tokens and original data is kept in the Sankofa privacy layer
5. When results are returned, tokens are replaced with the original information

### Can I trust that my sensitive information is really protected?

Yes. The system architecture ensures that:

1. Token Intelligence never sees your original data
2. No original data is stored in the intelligence system
3. All processing is done on tokens only
4. Tokens cannot be reverse-engineered to reveal original data

You can verify these claims by reviewing our code, inspecting the data flows, and checking our privacy validation tests.

### What is the Sankofa Privacy Layer?

Sankofa is our specialized privacy layer that handles tokenization and protects your sensitive information. It:

1. Tokenizes sensitive information in your content
2. Maintains the mapping between tokens and original data
3. Ensures consistent token mapping within sessions
4. Detokenizes results before presenting them to you

## Usage Questions

### How do I add content to the knowledge base?

You can add content through:

1. **Stream of Consciousness**: Just write naturally and let the system organize it
   ```python
   kb.process_stream_of_consciousness("Need to meet with John about the project tomorrow")
   ```

2. **CLI Interface**: Use the command-line interface
   ```bash
   kb-cli add "Need to meet with John about the project tomorrow"
   ```

3. **API**: Make direct API calls for integration with other systems

### Can I search across different types of content?

Yes! You can search across all content types or filter by specific types:

```python
# Search all content
results = kb.search_content("project")

# Search only todos
todo_results = kb.search_content("project", content_type="todos")
```

With the CLI:
```bash
kb-cli search "project"
kb-cli search "project" --type todo
```

### How do I export my data?

You can export your data through:

1. **Privacy-Preserving Export**: Exports with privacy protection
   ```python
   privacy_integration.export_to_privacy_bundle()
   ```

2. **CLI Export**: Command-line export
   ```bash
   kb-cli export --privacy
   ```

3. **Direct File Access**: Access your knowledge base files directly

### What types of content can I store?

The system supports multiple content types:

1. **Notes**: General text notes and information
2. **Todos**: Task items with status, due dates, priorities
3. **Calendar Events**: Time-based events with duration, location
4. **Projects**: Collections of related content items
5. **References**: Links to external resources

## Technical Questions

### How is the knowledge base organized?

The knowledge base organizes content by:

1. **Type**: Content is stored in appropriate directories by type (notes, todos, etc.)
2. **Tags**: Content can be tagged for cross-cutting organization
3. **Categories**: Higher-level grouping of related content
4. **Relationships**: Content items can reference other items

### How does the token intelligence work without seeing my data?

Token intelligence works through:

1. **Context Preservation**: When tokenizing, contextual information is preserved
2. **Token Patterns**: The system analyzes patterns in how tokens are used
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Relationships between tokens are tracked
4. **Historical Analysis**: The system learns from token usage over time

### Can I host this system myself?

Yes, the system is designed to be self-hosted. You'll need:

1. Python 3.8+ installed on your system
2. Basic knowledge of command-line usage
3. Storage space for your knowledge base content
4. Optional: Web server for API access

## Integration Questions

### Can I use this with my existing tools?

Yes, the system is designed for integration:

1. **API Access**: Use the REST API to integrate with other applications
2. **File-Based Storage**: Direct access to the knowledge base files
3. **Import/Export**: Import from and export to other formats
4. **Plugins**: Planned integrations with popular productivity tools

### How do I integrate the privacy layer with my application?

To integrate with the privacy layer:

1. Install the Sankofa client package
2. Configure the integration in your application
3. Use the client to tokenize sensitive content
4. Pass tokenized content to the Knowledge Base or Token Intelligence
5. Use the client to detokenize responses

See the [Integration Guide](integration_guide.md) for detailed instructions.

### Can I extend the system with my own intelligence generators?

Yes, the system is designed to be extensible. You can:

1. Create new intelligence generators for specific token types
2. Add custom analyzers for specialized patterns
3. Implement domain-specific relationship detectors
4. Connect with other AI services through the API

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I not getting any intelligence results?

Possible causes:

1. **No Tokens**: Your content doesn't contain any recognizable tokens
2. **Token Format**: Tokens must follow the format `[TYPE_ID]`
3. **Session Consistency**: Check if you're using consistent session IDs
4. **Context Missing**: Provide more context for better intelligence

### How do I report issues or request features?

To report issues or request features:

1. **GitHub Issues**: Submit an issue on our GitHub repository

## Performance Questions

### How much data can the system handle?

The system is designed to be efficient with resources:

1. **Knowledge Base**: Can handle thousands of content items
2. **Token Intelligence**: Processes requests in < 2ms
3. **Storage**: Uses efficient file-based storage
4. **Memory Usage**: Minimal footprint with on-demand loading

For very large deployments, consider implementing a database backend.

### Will it work on my computer?

The system has minimal requirements:

1. **Operating System**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
2. **Python**: Requires Python 3.8+
