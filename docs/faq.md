## Command Line Usage

### How do I process content?
```python
from knowledge_base import KnowledgeBaseManager

kb = KnowledgeBaseManager()
result = kb.process_stream_of_consciousness(
    "Need to call John about Project X tomorrow at 2pm"
)
```

### How do I search for content?
```python
# Search across all content types
results = kb.search_content("project")

# Search specific content type
todo_results = kb.search_content("project", content_type="todos")
```

### Can I use it with my existing note-taking app?
Yes, you can integrate the Knowledge Base System with other applications:
- Use the Python API in your application
- Use the HTTP API for non-Python applications
- Process exported notes from your existing system
- Use the web interface directly

## Privacy Features

### How does the privacy protection work?
The system detects sensitive information (names, emails, projects, etc.) and replaces them with tokens like `[PERSON_001]`. Original values are stored securely and only reconstituted when needed.

### What privacy levels are available?
- **Minimal**: Basic entity detection (names, emails)
- **Standard**: Comprehensive entity detection (default)
- **Enhanced**: Maximum privacy with additional context analysis

### Can I use my own privacy rules?
Yes, you can configure privacy rules in `config/sankofa_integration.yaml` to customize entity detection and tokenization. In the web interface, you can manage privacy settings through the Settings page.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### What types of errors can I expect from the system?
The system uses a comprehensive error hierarchy:

- `KnowledgeBaseError`: Base class for all errors
- `ConfigurationError`: Issues with configuration files or settings
- `StorageError`: Problems with file I/O operations
- `ContentProcessingError`: Failures in content extraction
- `PrivacyError`: Issues with privacy operations
- `ValidationError`: Input validation failures
- `NotFoundError`: Requested resources not found
- `RecoveryError`: Failed recovery attempts

### How do I debug issues with the Knowledge Base?
Enable detailed logging to see what's happening:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('knowledge_base').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
handler = logging.StreamHandler()
handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'))
logging.getLogger('knowledge_base').addHandler(handler)
```

For web interface issues, check browser console logs and network requests.

### What is the circuit breaker pattern and why is it used?
The circuit breaker pattern is a fault tolerance mechanism that prevents cascading failures by monitoring for failures and "tripping" (like an electrical circuit breaker) when failures exceed a threshold. This:

1. Prevents overwhelming failing components/services
2. Allows for graceful degradation 
3. Enables automatic recovery testing

The Knowledge Base uses circuit breakers for critical operations like privacy processing and external service calls.

### What happens when a circuit breaker "trips"?
When a circuit breaker trips (enters the OPEN state):
1. Requests to that component are immediately rejected
2. Fallback mechanisms are triggered where available
3. After a timeout period, the circuit enters HALF-OPEN state
4. Some test traffic is allowed through to see if the issue is resolved
5. If successful, the circuit closes; if still failing, it returns to OPEN

### How can I check the status of circuit breakers?
Via the API:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/system/circuit-breakers
```

Or programmatically:
```python
from knowledge_base.privacy.circuit_breaker import CircuitBreakerRegistry
status = CircuitBreakerRegistry.get_instance().get_status()
```

### Why am I getting "CircuitBreakerOpenError" errors?
This means a component is experiencing failures and the circuit breaker has tripped. Options:
1. Wait for automatic recovery
2. Use a fallback mechanism
3. Manually reset the circuit breaker if you're sure the issue is resolved

### How do I reset a circuit breaker?
Via the API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/system/circuit-breakers/reset
```

Or programmatically:
```python
from knowledge_base.privacy.circuit_breaker import CircuitBreakerRegistry
CircuitBreakerRegistry.get_instance().reset_all()
```

### What fallback mechanisms are available when components fail?
1. **Privacy Engine Fallbacks**:
   - Minimal privacy processing when full processing fails
   - Reuse of existing tokens when intelligence services are unavailable
   - Preservation of original text when reconstruction fails

2. **Content Processing Fallbacks**:
   - Default values for tag extraction failures
   - Safe title generation when parsing fails
   - Conservative behavior with incomplete data

3. **Storage Fallbacks**:
   - In-memory operation when persistence fails
   - Automatic retry logic for transient errors

## Performance

### How can I optimize performance?
- Process content in batches rather than individually
- Use appropriate privacy levels (higher levels require more processing)
- Configure caching for frequently accessed content
- Consider the circuit breaker patterns and timeout configurations

### What's the recommended batch size for processing?
For optimal performance, process 10-50 items in a batch. Larger batches may improve throughput but increase memory usage and latency.

### How does the system handle high load?
The system uses:
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- Caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- Fallback behaviors when components are overloaded

## Integration

### How do I integrate with other applications?
1. **Python applications**: Import and use the `KnowledgeBaseManager` class directly
2. **Non-Python applications**: Use the REST API provided by the API server
3. **Data import/export**: Use the export/import functionality to exchange data

### How do I build a custom frontend for the Knowledge Base?
You can build a frontend using the REST API. Simply:
1. Start the API server: `kb-api-server`
2. Make HTTP requests to the API endpoints
3. Handle the JSON responses in your frontend code

Alternatively, you can customize the existing React frontend.

### Does the Knowledge Base support webhooks or callbacks?
Not currently, but you can implement polling using the API to check for changes.

## Advanced Topics

### How does token intelligence work?
The Token Intelligence system analyzes patterns and relationships between tokenized entities without accessing the original data. It can:
- Identify relationships between entities
- Generate context-appropriate suggestions
- Enhance content with additional metadata

### Can I extend the system with custom content types?
Yes, you can extend the system by:
1. Creating new content type classes
2. Registering them with the content type registry
3. Adding extraction patterns for your content type

### Is there a plugin system?
There's no formal plugin system yet, but you can extend the core classes to add functionality. A proper plugin system is planned for future releases.

### How do I migrate from legacy privacy.py to modern components?
The system includes adapter classes that provide backward compatibility. To migrate:

1. First, update imports to use the adapter classes:
   ```python
   # Instead of
   from knowledge_base.privacy import PrivacyIntegration
   
   # Use
   from knowledge_base.privacy.adapter import PrivacyIntegrationAdapter as PrivacyIntegration
   ```

2. Then, gradually update code to use the modern components directly:
   ```python
   from knowledge_base.privacy.smart_anonymization import SmartAnonymizer
   from knowledge_base.privacy.session_manager import PrivacySessionManager
   ```

Legacy components will emit deprecation warnings to help identify code that needs migration.

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I getting ConfigurationError?
Check that your configuration files exist and are valid YAML:
```bash
ls -la config/
python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('config/ai_instructions.yaml'))"
```

### Why isn't my content being saved?
Check storage permissions and paths:
```bash
ls -la data/
mkdir -p data/notes data/todos data/calendar
```

### Why are my privacy tokens inconsistent?
Use a consistent session ID across operations:
```python
session_id = "user-123"
result1 = kb.process_stream_of_consciousness("Meeting with John", session_id=session_id)
result2 = kb.process_stream_of_consciousness("Email from John", session_id=session_id)
```

### Why am I seeing "Resource temporarily unavailable" errors?
This may indicate that a circuit breaker is open. Check the circuit breaker status and consider using fallback options or waiting for recovery.

### Why is the web interface not loading properly?
Check for:
- Browser console errors (F12 to open developer tools)
- API server running and accessible
- Node.js version compatibility (16+ required)
- Missing npm packages (run `npm install` again)

### How do I restart the web interface after changes?
The development server should automatically reload on changes. If it doesn't:
1. Stop both frontend and backend servers (Ctrl+C)
2. Restart the backend: `cd web_interface/backend && python main.py`
3. Restart the frontend: `cd web_interface/frontend && npm start`

## Mobile Support

### Can I use the Knowledge Base System on mobile devices?
Yes, the web interface is responsive and works on mobile browsers. It automatically adapts to different screen sizes and touch interfaces.

### Are there mobile apps available?
There are no native mobile apps yet, but the web interface is designed to work well on mobile devices. Native mobile applications are planned for future releases.
