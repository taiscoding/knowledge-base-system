# Knowledge Base System: Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is the Knowledge Base System?
The Knowledge Base System is a tool for organizing and processing unstructured content into structured, searchable information while maintaining privacy. It extracts todos, events, notes, and other content types from raw text.

### What are the main features?
- Content extraction and organization
- Privacy protection for sensitive information
- Token intelligence for privacy-safe insights
- Searching across different content types
- Integration with other applications via API

### What programming languages/platforms are supported?
The system is built in Python and can be used in any Python environment (3.8+). The API server allows integration with any programming language or platform that can make HTTP requests.

## Setup and Installation

### How do I install the Knowledge Base System?
```bash
# Via pip
pip install knowledge-base-system

# Or from source
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/knowledge-base-system.git
cd knowledge-base-system
pip install -e .
```

### What are the system requirements?
- Python 3.8 or higher
- 4GB RAM (minimum)
- 100MB disk space (plus space for your content)

### How do I configure the system?
Configuration is managed through:
- YAML files in the `config/` directory
- Environment variables (prefixed with `KB_`)
- Command-line arguments for the CLI

## Usage

### How do I process content?
```python
from knowledge_base import KnowledgeBaseManager

kb = KnowledgeBaseManager()
result = kb.process_stream_of_consciousness(
    "Need to call John about Project X tomorrow at 2pm"
)
```

### How do I search for content?
```python
# Search across all content types
results = kb.search_content("project")

# Search specific content type
todo_results = kb.search_content("project", content_type="todos")
```

### Can I use it with my existing note-taking app?
Yes, you can integrate the Knowledge Base System with other applications:
- Use the Python API in your application
- Use the HTTP API for non-Python applications
- Process exported notes from your existing system

## Privacy Features

### How does the privacy protection work?
The system detects sensitive information (names, emails, projects, etc.) and replaces them with tokens like `[PERSON_001]`. Original values are stored securely and only reconstituted when needed.

### What privacy levels are available?
- **Minimal**: Basic entity detection (names, emails)
- **Standard**: Comprehensive entity detection (default)
- **Enhanced**: Maximum privacy with additional context analysis

### Can I use my own privacy rules?
Yes, you can configure privacy rules in `config/sankofa_integration.yaml` to customize entity detection and tokenization.

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### What types of errors can I expect from the system?
The system uses a comprehensive error hierarchy:

- `KnowledgeBaseError`: Base class for all errors
- `ConfigurationError`: Issues with configuration files or settings
- `StorageError`: Problems with file I/O operations
- `ContentProcessingError`: Failures in content extraction
- `PrivacyError`: Issues with privacy operations
- `ValidationError`: Input validation failures
- `NotFoundError`: Requested resources not found
- `RecoveryError`: Failed recovery attempts

### How do I debug issues with the Knowledge Base?
Enable detailed logging to see what's happening:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('knowledge_base').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
handler = logging.StreamHandler()
handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'))
logging.getLogger('knowledge_base').addHandler(handler)
```

### What is the circuit breaker pattern and why is it used?
The circuit breaker pattern is a fault tolerance mechanism that prevents cascading failures by monitoring for failures and "tripping" (like an electrical circuit breaker) when failures exceed a threshold. This:

1. Prevents overwhelming failing components/services
2. Allows for graceful degradation 
3. Enables automatic recovery testing

The Knowledge Base uses circuit breakers for critical operations like privacy processing and external service calls.

### What happens when a circuit breaker "trips"?
When a circuit breaker trips (enters the OPEN state):
1. Requests to that component are immediately rejected
2. Fallback mechanisms are triggered where available
3. After a timeout period, the circuit enters HALF-OPEN state
4. Some test traffic is allowed through to see if the issue is resolved
5. If successful, the circuit closes; if still failing, it returns to OPEN

### How can I check the status of circuit breakers?
Via the API:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/v1/system/circuit-breakers
```

Or programmatically:
```python
from knowledge_base.privacy.circuit_breaker import CircuitBreakerRegistry
status = CircuitBreakerRegistry.get_instance().get_status()
```

### Why am I getting "CircuitBreakerOpenError" errors?
This means a component is experiencing failures and the circuit breaker has tripped. Options:
1. Wait for automatic recovery
2. Use a fallback mechanism
3. Manually reset the circuit breaker if you're sure the issue is resolved

### How do I reset a circuit breaker?
Via the API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/system/circuit-breakers/reset
```

Or programmatically:
```python
from knowledge_base.privacy.circuit_breaker import CircuitBreakerRegistry
CircuitBreakerRegistry.get_instance().reset_all()
```

### What fallback mechanisms are available when components fail?
1. **Privacy Engine Fallbacks**:
   - Minimal privacy processing when full processing fails
   - Reuse of existing tokens when intelligence services are unavailable
   - Preservation of original text when reconstruction fails

2. **Content Processing Fallbacks**:
   - Default values for tag extraction failures
   - Safe title generation when parsing fails
   - Conservative behavior with incomplete data

3. **Storage Fallbacks**:
   - In-memory operation when persistence fails
   - Automatic retry logic for transient errors

## Performance

### How can I optimize performance?
- Process content in batches rather than individually
- Use appropriate privacy levels (higher levels require more processing)
- Configure caching for frequently accessed content
- Consider the circuit breaker patterns and timeout configurations

### What's the recommended batch size for processing?
For optimal performance, process 10-50 items in a batch. Larger batches may improve throughput but increase memory usage and latency.

### How does the system handle high load?
The system uses:
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- Caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- Fallback behaviors when components are overloaded

## Integration

### How do I integrate with other applications?
1. **Python applications**: Import and use the `KnowledgeBaseManager` class directly
2. **Non-Python applications**: Use the REST API provided by the API server
3. **Data import/export**: Use the export/import functionality to exchange data

### How do I build a frontend for the Knowledge Base?
You can build a frontend using the REST API. Simply:
1. Start the API server: `kb-api-server`
2. Make HTTP requests to the API endpoints
3. Handle the JSON responses in your frontend code

### Does the Knowledge Base support webhooks or callbacks?
Not currently, but you can implement polling using the API to check for changes.

## Advanced Topics

### How does token intelligence work?
The Token Intelligence system analyzes patterns and relationships between tokenized entities without accessing the original data. It can:
- Identify relationships between entities
- Generate context-appropriate suggestions
- Enhance content with additional metadata

### Can I extend the system with custom content types?
Yes, you can extend the system by:
1. Creating new content type classes
2. Registering them with the content type registry
3. Adding extraction patterns for your content type

### Is there a plugin system?
There's no formal plugin system yet, but you can extend the core classes to add functionality. A proper plugin system is planned for future releases.

### How do I migrate from legacy privacy.py to modern components?
The system includes adapter classes that provide backward compatibility. To migrate:

1. First, update imports to use the adapter classes:
   ```python
   # Instead of
   from knowledge_base.privacy import PrivacyIntegration
   
   # Use
   from knowledge_base.privacy.adapter import PrivacyIntegrationAdapter as PrivacyIntegration
   ```

2. Then, gradually update code to use the modern components directly:
   ```python
   from knowledge_base.privacy.smart_anonymization import SmartAnonymizer
   from knowledge_base.privacy.session_manager import PrivacySessionManager
   ```

Legacy components will emit deprecation warnings to help identify code that needs migration.

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I getting ConfigurationError?
Check that your configuration files exist and are valid YAML:
```bash
ls -la config/
python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('config/ai_instructions.yaml'))"
```

### Why isn't my content being saved?
Check storage permissions and paths:
```bash
ls -la data/
mkdir -p data/notes data/todos data/calendar
```

### Why are my privacy tokens inconsistent?
Use a consistent session ID across operations:
```python
session_id = "user-123"
result1 = kb.process_stream_of_consciousness("Meeting with John", session_id=session_id)
result2 = kb.process_stream_of_consciousness("Email from John", session_id=session_id)
```

### Why am I seeing "Resource temporarily unavailable" errors?
This may indicate that a circuit breaker is open. Check the circuit breaker status and consider using fallback options or waiting for recovery.
