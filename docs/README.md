## Running Examples

You can run the example scripts directly:

```bash
# Make sure you have the Knowledge Base System installed
pip install -e ..

# Run basic usage example
python examples/basic_usage.py

# Run hierarchical organization examples
python examples/hierarchy_examples.py

# Run semantic search examples
python examples/semantic_search_examples.py

# Make sure the API server is running for this example
python examples/api_client.py
```

## Starting the API Server

To start the API server for testing:

```bash
# From the project root
python -m scripts.api_server
```

## Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run hierarchical organization tests
python -m pytest tests/test_integration_hierarchy.py

# Run privacy tests with coverage report
python -m pytest tests/privacy/ --cov=knowledge_base.privacy

# Run benchmarks
python -m pytest tests/benchmarks/

# View circuit breaker status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/system/circuit-breakers
```
