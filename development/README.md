# Development Resources

This directory contains development resources, planning documents, and historical records that are not part of the main codebase or user-facing documentation.

## Records

Historical records of development activities:

- [Test Coverage Summary](records/TEST_COVERAGE_SUMMARY.md) - Snapshot of test coverage statistics (June 2025)
- [Privacy Migration Plan](records/PRIVACY_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) - Internal plan for privacy module migration
- [Development Tasks Summary](records/DEVELOPMENT_TASKS_SUMMARY.md) - Summary of completed development tasks
- [Documentation Cleanup Summary](records/DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md) - Overview of documentation cleanup efforts
- [Documentation Update Summary](records/DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md) - Summary of documentation updates
- [Reorganization Summary](records/REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md) - Overview of codebase reorganization efforts
- [Milestone 1 Plan](records/MILESTONE_1_PLAN.md) - Planning document for Milestone 1

## Purpose

These files are maintained for:

1. **Historical Reference** - Track decisions and progress over time
2. **Development Context** - Provide context for why certain approaches were taken
3. **Knowledge Preservation** - Maintain knowledge for future developers

## Relationship to Documentation

Development records are distinct from user/developer documentation in the `docs/` directory:

- **Development Records**: Internal, historical, planning-focused
- **Documentation**: Current, user-facing, usage-focused

## Maintenance Guidelines

To prevent clutter:

1. Only add new records when they provide significant value
2. Consider archiving old records after major versions
3. Keep user-facing documentation in the `docs/` directory
4. Update this index when adding new records
