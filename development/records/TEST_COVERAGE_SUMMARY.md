  - Tests for all exception types
  - Tests for exception inheritance
  - Tests for error message formatting
  - Tests for contextual error information

### Circuit Breaker Tests

Added tests for the circuit breaker pattern implementation:

- **tests/privacy/test_circuit_breaker.py**: Unit tests for the circuit breaker implementation
  - Tests for state transitions (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN)
  - Tests for failure counting and threshold behavior
  - Tests for automatic recovery timeout
  - Tests for metrics collection
  - Tests for thread safety

- **tests/privacy/test_smart_anonymization_circuit.py**: Integration tests for circuit breaker with privacy components
  - Tests for circuit breaker protection of anonymization operations
  - Tests for fallback behavior when circuit is open
  - Tests for recovery behavior
  - Tests for circuit breaker registry

### Privacy Component Tests

- **tests/privacy/test_smart_anonymization.py**: Tests for smart anonymization features
  - Tests for entity detection and tokenization
  - Tests for token consistency
  - Tests for different privacy levels
  - Tests for error handling in privacy operations

## Test Improvements

### Parameterized Tests

Added parameterized tests to improve test coverage efficiency:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_text, expected_tokens", [
    ("Meet with John tomorrow", {"[PERSON_001]": "John"}),
    ("Email sarah@example.com", {"[EMAIL_001]": "sarah@example.com"}),
    ("Call 555-123-4567", {"[PHONE_001]": "555-123-4567"}),
    # More test cases...
])
def test_tokenize_entities(input_text, expected_tokens):
    anonymizer = SmartAnonymizer()
    result = anonymizer.tokenize(input_text)
    assert result.tokens == expected_tokens
```

### Test Fixtures

Created reusable fixtures for common test scenarios:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def circuit_breaker():
    return CircuitBreaker(
        name="test_circuit",
        failure_threshold=3,
        reset_timeout_ms=100
    )

@pytest.fixture
def privacy_session():
    session_manager = PrivacySessionManager()
    session_id = session_manager.create_session()
    return session_manager, session_id
```

### Mock Components

Improved tests with proper mocking of dependencies:

```python
@patch("knowledge_base.privacy.token_intelligence_bridge.TokenIntelligenceBridge")
def test_smart_anonymization_with_token_intelligence(mock_bridge):
    # Configure mock
    mock_bridge.return_value.generate_intelligence.return_value = {
        "[PERSON_001]": {"context": "professional"}
    }
    
    # Test with mock
    anonymizer = SmartAnonymizer(token_intelligence_bridge=mock_bridge.return_value)
    result = anonymizer.tokenize_with_intelligence("Meeting with John")
    
    # Verify
    assert "[PERSON_001]" in result.tokens
    assert mock_bridge.return_value.generate_intelligence.called
```

## Edge Case Coverage

Added specific tests for edge cases and error conditions:

- **Empty input handling**: Tests for empty or None inputs
- **Invalid configuration**: Tests for misconfigured components
- **Resource exhaustion**: Tests for memory and file handle limits
- **Concurrent access**: Tests for thread safety and race conditions
- **Recovery scenarios**: Tests for system recovery after failures

## Performance Tests

Added benchmark tests to measure performance:

```python
def test_tokenization_performance(benchmark):
    anonymizer = SmartAnonymizer()
    text = "Meeting with John Smith about Project X tomorrow at 2pm"
    
    result = benchmark(anonymizer.tokenize, text)
    
    assert result is not None
    assert "[PERSON_001]" in result.tokens
```

## Uncovered Areas

Some areas remain with lower coverage:

| Component | Coverage | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Token Intelligence Bridge | 90% | Caching functionality needs additional tests |
| Circuit Breaker Edge Cases | 85% | More tests needed for race conditions |
| Batch Processing | 88% | Tests for very large batches needed |

## Next Steps

1. Add missing tests for token intelligence bridge caching
2. Implement additional tests for circuit breaker edge cases
3. Extend tests for very large batch processing
4. Add integration tests for the full pipeline
5. Implement continuous integration with coverage reporting
