# Milestone 1: Core Stability and Performance

This document outlines the plan for Milestone 1 of the Knowledge Base System, focusing on core stability, performance, and increased test coverage.

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Privacy Integration**
   - ✅ Integrated the privacy functionality directly into the Knowledge Base System
   - ✅ Implemented the PrivacyEngine for tokenization and de-tokenization
   - ✅ Created the PrivacySessionManager for managing privacy sessions
   - ✅ Added the TokenIntelligenceBridge for fault-tolerant token intelligence
   - ✅ Implemented entity relationship detection between tokens
   - ✅ Updated the documentation to reflect the integrated approach

2. **Basic Functionality**
   - ✅ Content processing with privacy preservation
   - ✅ Stream of consciousness processing
   - ✅ Intelligent response generation
   - ✅ CLI interface with privacy commands
   - ✅ REST API for privacy-aware operations

3. **Test Infrastructure and Coverage**
   - ✅ Set up automated test runner with pytest
   - ✅ Implemented code coverage tracking with pytest-cov
   - ✅ Created test fixtures and mock data for privacy components
   - ✅ Achieved 96% test coverage for privacy components
   - ✅ Implemented benchmark tests with pytest-benchmark
   - ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests for all privacy components
   - ✅ Added integration tests for privacy workflow

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Test Environment

```bash
# Install test dependencies
python -m pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-mock pytest-benchmark

# Run the test suite
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=knowledge_base

# Generate detailed coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=knowledge_base --cov-report=html
```

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Run benchmark tests
python -m pytest tests/benchmarks/ --benchmark-only

# Run specific benchmark test
python -m pytest tests/benchmarks/test_privacy_benchmarks.py::TestPrivacyBenchmarks::test_deidentify_small_text

# Profile a specific component
python -m cProfile -o profile.out knowledge_base/tests/benchmarks/privacy_benchmark.py
