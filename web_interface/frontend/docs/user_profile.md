# User Profile Management

The Knowledge Base System provides comprehensive user profile management features. This document outlines the available profile management capabilities and how to use them.

## Profile Overview

The User Profile page allows users to manage their personal information, preferences, and security settings in a central location. The profile is organized into three main sections:

1. **Personal Information**: Basic user details and preferences
2. **Preferences**: User interface and content preferences
3. **Security**: Password and session management

## Personal Information

The Personal Information tab allows users to manage their basic profile data:

- **Display Name**: The name displayed throughout the application
- **Email**: The primary email address associated with the account
- **Bio**: A short user biography or description
- **Location**: Geographic location information
- **Tags & Interests**: User-specified tags representing interests or expertise areas

### Managing Tags

Users can add and remove tags to represent their interests:

1. To add a tag, type the tag name in the "Add tag" field and press Enter
2. To remove a tag, click the delete (Ã—) icon on any tag

Tags help improve content recommendations and can be used to categorize content.

## Preferences

The Preferences tab provides options to customize the user experience:

- **Display Preferences**: 
  - Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark interface themes
  
- **Interface Preferences**:
  - Keyboard Shortcuts: Enable or disable keyboard shortcuts

  - Auto-tagging: Enable automatic tag suggestions for new content

### Keyboard Shortcuts

When keyboard shortcuts are enabled, users can view available shortcuts in the Preferences tab. For detailed information, see the [Keyboard Shortcuts](./keyboard_shortcuts.md) documentation.

## Security

The Security tab provides options for managing account security:

- **Password Management**:
  - Change Password: Update the user account password
  - Password requirements are displayed during the change process
  
- **Two-Factor Authentication**:
  - Enable/disable two-factor authentication for additional security
  
- **Session Management**:
  - View active sessions
  - Log out from other sessions

## Profile Picture

Users can update their profile picture by:

1. Clicking on their current avatar in the profile overview
2. Selecting a new image file from their device
3. Cropping the image if needed
4. Saving the changes

## Responsive Design

The user profile interface is fully responsive and optimized for:

- **Desktop**: Full multi-column layout
