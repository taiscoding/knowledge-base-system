## Current Development Focus

We've successfully completed Milestone 2 (Enhanced Knowledge Organization) and are now focused on Milestone 3 (Privacy Enhancements):

### Recently Completed âœ…
- **Hierarchical Organization** - Unlimited nested folder structure
- **Relationship Management** - Explicit connections between content items  
- **Semantic Search** - Vector-based content similarity search
- **Smart Recommendations** - Context-aware content suggestions

See our [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for more details.

## Core Development Principles

1. **Privacy by Design**: All features must preserve our privacy model
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Maintain our 91% test coverage standard
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Use the circuit breaker pattern for critical operations
4. **Documentation**: Update docs as you implement features
5. **Semantic Intelligence**: Enhance discoverability and connections
