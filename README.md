# Knowledge Base System with Integrated Privacy

A unified system that combines intelligent knowledge management with built-in privacy protection.

## üëã Welcome!

This system provides a secure way to manage your knowledge while protecting privacy through intelligent tokenization. The project integrates:

1. **Knowledge Base Manager**: Organizes and processes your notes, todos, events, and other content
2. **Privacy Layer**: Ensures your data remains private through smart anonymization
3. **Token Intelligence**: Generates insights from privacy tokens without accessing original data

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Privacy-First Design
- **Smart Anonymization**: Preserves essential information while protecting personal identifiers
- **Automatic De-anonymization**: System responses are automatically de-anonymized for users
- **Entity Relationships**: Links related information (person ‚Üî phone, email, etc.) using privacy tokens
- **Perfect Session Isolation**: Complete privacy boundaries between usage contexts

### Smart Organization
- **Intelligent Processing**: Automatically categorizes and organizes your content
- **Context Awareness**: Recognizes relationships between different pieces of information
- **Personalized Intelligence**: Learns from usage patterns while maintaining privacy

### Rich Capabilities  
- **Multiple Content Types**: Notes, tasks, calendar events, projects, and more
- **Search & Discovery**: Find connections across your knowledge base
- **API Integration**: Connect with other tools through a clean REST API
- **Conversational Interface**: Chat naturally with your knowledge base

### Quality & Reliability
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 96% test coverage for privacy components
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Continuous performance monitoring
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when components fail

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install knowledge-base-system

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/taiscoding/knowledge-base-system.git
cd knowledge-base-system
pip install -e .
```

### Quick Example

```python
from knowledge_base import KnowledgeBaseManager

# Initialize the integrated knowledge base
kb = KnowledgeBaseManager()

# Create a privacy session
session_id = kb.session_manager.create_session("balanced")

# Process content with privacy
result = kb.process_with_privacy(
    "Need to meet with John about the marketing project tomorrow at 2pm.",
    session_id=session_id
)

# See what was extracted
print(f"Found {len(result['extracted_info']['todos'])} todos")
print(f"Found {len(result['extracted_info']['calendar_events'])} events")
print(f"Privacy-safe text: {result['original_content']}")

# Process and get AI response
response = kb.process_and_respond(
    "Call John tomorrow about the project status.",
    session_id=session_id
)

print(f"AI Response: {response['response']['message']}")
print(f"Suggestions: {[s['text'] for s in response['response']['suggestions']]}")
```

## üîÑ System Architecture

The system is designed with privacy built into every component:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Content] -->|Tokenization| B[Privacy Engine]
    B -->|Tokenized Content| C[Knowledge Base Manager]
    
    C -->|Organization & Storage| D[Knowledge Base]
    C -->|Privacy-Safe Tokens| E[Token Intelligence Engine]
    
    E -->|Token Intelligence| C
    C -->|Enhanced Content| F[AI Response Generator]
    F -->|Anonymized Response| B
    B -->|De-anonymized Response| A
    
    subgraph "Knowledge System"
    C
    D
    E
    F
    end
    
    subgraph "Privacy Layer"
    B
    end
```

This flow ensures that:
1. User input is properly anonymized
2. Processing happens with privacy tokens (never the original data)
3. Responses are automatically de-anonymized before being shown to users

- **Privacy Engine**: Smart anonymization of sensitive information
- **Knowledge Base**: Manages content organization and processing
- **Token Intelligence**: Provides privacy-safe insights from tokens
- **Content Store**: Securely stores all your knowledge
- **Response Generator**: Creates helpful responses and suggestions

## üîí Privacy & Security

This system was built with privacy as the core principle:

1. **Built-in Privacy**: Privacy engine integrated into every operation
2. **Smart Anonymization**: Only sensitive data is tokenized, preserving essential context
3. **Zero Re-identification Risk**: Design prevents any possibility of reconstructing original data
4. **Session Isolation**: Usage contexts are kept completely separate
5. **Entity Relationships**: Understand connections between entities without exposing identities

For a complete privacy overview, see our [Privacy Design](docs/privacy_design.md) documentation.

## üß™ Testing & Quality

We maintain high code quality through:

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: 96% test coverage for privacy components
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Regular benchmarking of key operations
3. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Ongoing enhancement of tests and code quality
